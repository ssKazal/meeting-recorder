## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security problems.**

Use GitHub's private reporting:
[**Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/ssKazal/meeting-recorder/security/advisories/new)

Please include what you did, what happened, and the impact. You can expect an
acknowledgement within a few days.

## Scope — why this matters here

This application can record your screen, microphone and system audio, so
please pay particular attention to:

- Anything that causes a recording to start **without the user's consent**
  (the permission prompt being bypassed or spoofed).
- Anything that discloses recordings, or writes them somewhere world-readable.
- Command injection via configuration values that reach `ffmpeg` (for example
  `capture_region`, `noise_model_path` or `output_dir`).
- Privilege issues in the `.deb` maintainer scripts.

## Design notes relevant to security

- The daemon runs as a **systemd user service** with your own privileges — never
  as root. It deliberately is not a system service.
- Recordings are written to `~/Videos/MeetingRecorder/` (configurable) and owned
  by you.
- Nothing is uploaded anywhere: the app has **no network functionality**.
- Detection reads audio-stream metadata via `pactl`; it never reads audio content
  to decide whether to record.
